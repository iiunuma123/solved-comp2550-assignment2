The purpose of this assignment is to assess student’s ability to understand a technical research paper in the area of research of your tutorial with a critical view. While assignment 1 was about going broad, this assignment is about going deep. For each tutorial, the tutors selected different papers and assigned one of them to you randomly. You can find the papers assigned to you on Wattle, under Tutorial Material, folder “Assignment 2”. Your tutor will email to you, which of the papers has been randomly assigned to you.

The assignment consists of 9 questions. You should be able to answer all questions after carefully reading the assigned paper. We assumed that it should not take you more than around 7.5-10h to thoroughly complete the assignment. We recommend you listen to the lecture on Literature Analysis on echo360, which was the make-up lecture for the March 8 public holiday.

<em>Note: Short and precise answers are preferred. Answer in your own words. Please do not exceed around 250 words per question. </em>
